# 📁 File Explorer for NTFS and FAT32 Partitions 🔍

## 🗂️ Overview
This project is a Python-based file explorer that can read and display files and directories from NTFS and FAT32 partitions on removable media (USB drives). It provides a graphical user interface to navigate the file system, view file properties, and read text file contents.

## ✨ Features
- Supports both NTFS and FAT32 file systems
- Displays file hierarchy in a tree view
- Shows detailed file information (name, attributes, size, dates)
- Allows viewing text file contents
- Refresh functionality to reload disk data
- Icons for different file types

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `wmi` (for Windows Management Instrumentation)
  - `tkinter` (for GUI)
  - `Pillow` (for image handling)

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure you have administrator privileges to access raw disk data

## 🚀 Usage
1. Connect a USB drive with NTFS or FAT32 partitions to your computer
2. Run the application by administrator privileges:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
3. The application will:
- Detect removable media
- Read partition tables
- Parse NTFS and FAT32 file systems
- Display the file hierarchy in a graphical interface

## 📂 File Structure
- asset/: Directory containing icon images
- data/: Directory for storing temporary data files
- helper/'
   - `NTFS.py`: NTFS file system parser
   - `FAT32.py`: FAT32 file system parser
- `main.py`: Main application with GUI
- `README.md`: Project documentation
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages
                          
## 🎛️ Controls
- Click on folders to expand/collapse directory structure
- Select files to view their properties and content
- Use the refresh button to reload data from disk

## ℹ️ Notes
- The application is designed for Windows systems
- Only text file contents can be displayed (other file types will show size and attributes only)
- The application requires administrator privileges to access raw disk data

## ❓ Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors:
1. Ensure the USB drive is properly connected
2. Verify you have administrator privileges
3. Check that the drive has either NTFS or FAT32 partitions
4. Make sure all required Python packages are installed
5. This application only supports reading at most 3 partitions at a time.
